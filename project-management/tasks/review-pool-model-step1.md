# Review Pool Model Step 1 (third attempt)

Look at TASK-134eb961 (PR #77, closed as stale) and assess:

- What did the agent actually implement? Check the branch/diff.
- Why did it fail — was the code bad, or just went stale?
- Can it be salvaged (reopen PR, rebase, retry) or does it need a full rework?
- Also check TASK-ed00d313 and TASK-3ca8857a for context on earlier failures.

Steps 2-4 are waiting in incoming and depend on this being done first.
