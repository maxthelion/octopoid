# The orchestrator task approval tests (resolve_task_id, find_agent_submodule,
# find_submodule_branch, find_main_repo_branch, rebase_onto_origin, run_tests,
# push_to_origin, accept_in_db, approve_orchestrator_task, parse_test_failures,
# run_tests_with_baseline) all relied on the local SQLite database which has been
# replaced by the API.
